# Personal Portfolio (Abondoned)

Welcome to my first abondoned (actual project).

This was supposed to be my **first portfolio project** (version 1). However; for a few reasons, I decided to **stop working on this project** and focus on a different design & tool.

### Why Abondon? 

I dislike 'butchering' my products, I like to ensure a nice clean finish to all my projects. They don't always have to be perfect, but they need to atleast be good.

The code in this project was far from good, it was awful, I had restructured it multiple times and can't seem to get comfortable with the overal feel of the page.
I will likely come back to this in the future.

#### The Good
- Design and layout.
- Overall Theme and color layout.

#### The Bad
- Responsiveness
- Overall Sizing of Items.
